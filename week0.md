# Week 0

Hi everyone, welcome to the **Python track, cruX Summer Group 2022**!

@SimpLord#8622 (Shivansh), @counterbutter#2822 (Chinmay), and I (Soumitra) will be your mentors for this summer group.

## Intro

Python is a really good first-choice if you want to get into programming. Even when doing scripting, you'll learn a wide range of things that would help you a lot in other fields of programming. It's breadth will help you in general programming logic, linux scripting, automation, backend development, and much much more. Another big plus that Python is known for, is prototyping. Making quick projects that demonstrate if an idea works or not can be usually done in no time using Python.

Keep in mind, our goal here is to teach you the basics of a wide range of things, and not to make you an expert in a niche topic. Of course, nobody is stopping you from doing that on your own. This is more to help people find what interests them. As we are casting a wide net, Google will be your best friend. Don't ever refrain from googling or asking questions no matter how dumb they might seem.

We will soon create a GitHub repo, where all the resources for the summer group will go.

For **week 0**, we will get done with the setup for VSCode and Python, and some extensions.
Here's a really nice video explaining exactly what VSCode is, and what extensions are. You will also run a test python file to test your install. Follow along, and you'll be familiar with VSCode in no time:

After this, install `virtualenv`:

Open a Command Prompt/Terminal, and here, enter the command:
```
pip install virtualenv
```
After this, run
```
virtualenv --version
```
and make sure it doesn't error out.

We'll discuss what virtual environments are, and why we use them very soon, in Week 1.

If you have any issues with installation, or have any questions whatsoever, you can ask them in #discussion  or you can DM me or any of the mentors. Don't be afraid to ask!
