# Week 1

Scripting one of the most important skills in the world of programming. The ability to automate, and speed up a lot of menial jobs can help you in everyday life.

Logging in automatically to BITS LAN or WiFi, automating an expense spreadsheet, programming specific shortcuts to perform key combos in games, having macros for your BITS ID and email, mass moving and renaming files, auto-enrolling and unenrolling from CMS, extracting slides from a lecture video, are some place where I use scripts all the time, and I can see these skills saving hours of people's time.

This is what we'll learn throughout this summer group. General scripting that will introduce you to programming, how websites work, how your computer works, and some techniques to make your life easier.

Over this summer group, we'll try to cover as much general scripting as we can, and a lot of what we'll do is from the book **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python** by **Al Sweigart**. This is an amazing book, and it is completely free under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) license.

The book covers some old packages that aren't maintained, used, or working today, and doesn't cover things like OpenCV and Selenium. This is why we recommend you not to follow the book, but stick with the summer group.

For this week, we will just learn Python the language. Hopefully, starting from next week, we can start covering packages and automation.

Since this week we'll learn Python, we'll have a small quiz to test your knowledge. All the quizzes will be **open book** unless otherwise mentioned, and will only test your knowledge on basic Python. Post this week, we'll switch to assignments since you'll be comfortable enough with Python by then.

**Starting off**

First off, we will start by learning how to use the REPL. The REPL is an interactive shell for Python, where you can test out small snippets of code, and work on them in an interactive manner.

To run the REPL, open a Terminal. This could be the VSCode terminal, that you can open using the 
```
Cmd/Ctrl + `
```
Key. The \` key is the key to the left of your `1` key.

If you don't want to use the VSCode terminal, you can also use the Mac Terminal, or any of the Windows Terminal, Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt terminals.

After you have your terminal opened, type in `python` and hit enter. This should open the REPL.

REPL stands for "Read–eval–print loop". This means, it reads in the command you type in, evaluates it, prints whatever output it generates, and then loops back to reading. This gives us an interactive environment to run our code in.

You can exit this REPL by closing your terminal window, or by typing in `exit()`.

You can use this place to test code, and practice Python.

**Python Basics**

For today, you just have to learn what Python variables are, what types exist, how you print them, how Python syntax works, and operators.
